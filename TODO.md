- ~~when new user is created, set user.score to 0~~
- ~~when the user is logged in redirect to '/' but via the home controller you provide the username to angular, on index.html you can then load in the view (in the ng-view container) that's needed (if not logged in the login buttons, if logged in the actual game~~)
- ~~player moves with azerty~~
- ~~name the tank after the user. so the user doesn't have to type a name~~
- ~~when bullet hits tank show impact~~
- ~~add two more tank designs~~
- Jasmine with a unit test
- get rid of jQuery: rewrite jQuery parts with vanilla javascript
- add obstacles to the game (i.e. sandbags and barrels) (see assets folder)
- **program game ending scenario: when a team has 20 kills they win and the game resets**
- save the score of a user after the game: each kill add 1 point to the score, each death subtracts 1 point from the player's score.
- at start of game check if other players are on field
- **killfeed**
- fix balls going out of #arena
- moving tank draws trails (see assets folder)
- change movement of the tanks, so that: A becomes turning to the left instead of going to the left. This will make the tanks a lot slower and more realistic.
- different specs for each team.
- **leaderboards**
- when shooting show smoke around the cannon.
