- ~~when new user is created, set user.score to 0~~
- let users create an account without a password. (placeholder text > Password is not needed but is safer.) This requires some extra checks in passport.js
- ~~when the user is logged in redirect to '/' but via the home controller you provide the username to angular, on index.html you can then load in the view (in the ng-view container) that's needed (if not logged in the login buttons, if logged in the actual game~~)
- Jasmine with a unit test
- get rid of jQuery: rewrite jQuery parts with vanilla javascript
- add obstacles to the game
- ~~name the tank after the user. so the user doesn't have to type a name~~
- program game ending scenario: when a team has 20 kills they win and the game resets
- save the score of a user after the game: each kill add 1 point to the score, each death subtracts 1 point from the player's score.
